# Onsen - OLED pastel green/blue theme
# Philosophy: Monochromatic pastel green base with blue for structure,
# orange for warnings, and red for errors only.
#
# Palette:
#   Green (#8FD9A8) - behavior, data, success, variables
#   Blue (#A8C4F7) - structure, keywords, directories
#   Orange (#FF9E50) - warnings, attention
#   Red (#FF6B6B) - errors only
